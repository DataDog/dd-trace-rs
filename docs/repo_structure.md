# Repository Structure

This is a Cargo workspace. The production crate is `datadog-opentelemetry`; the examples under
`datadog-opentelemetry/examples/` are separate workspace members with `publish = false`.

**Key visibility rule**: `core` is `pub(crate)` by default; it is re-exported as `pub` only when the
`test-utils` feature is enabled (used by integration tests). Only `configuration` and `log` modules
are always public.

**Feature flags** (in `datadog-opentelemetry/Cargo.toml`):

- `metrics-grpc` / `metrics-http` — OTLP transport for metrics (default: grpc)
- `logs-grpc` / `logs-http` — OTLP transport for logs (default: grpc)
- `test-utils` — exposes internal helpers and pulls in test dependencies; never enable in production
  builds

## datadog-opentelemetry

The `datadog-opentelemetry` crate is organized into several internal modules, each with distinct
responsibilities in the tracing pipeline:

- Core library features in `core::`
  - Configuration
  - Instrumentation telemetry
  - Logging
  - Constant definitions
- Distributed context propagation in `propagation`
- Span/Trace Sampling in `sampling`
- OpenTelemetry SDK compatible components at the root level
  - The Span processor/exporter
  - A trace registry that tracks extra span information
  - A compatibility layer for the Propagator
  - A compatibility layer for the Sampler

## Span tracking

### DatadogSpanProcessor

DatadogSpanProcessor implements the OpenTelemetry SpanProcessor trait and serves as the central
orchestrator for span lifecycle management. It coordinates between the registry, exporter, and other
subsystems.

Responsibilities:

- Hook into OpenTelemetry span creation (on_start) and completion (on_end)
- Register spans with TraceRegistry to track open/finished spans
- Add propagation data (sampling decisions, origin, tags) to completed traces
- Trigger export of complete or partial traces
- Coordinate shutdown of dependent components

### TraceRegistry

TraceRegistry maintains state for all in-flight traces using a sharded architecture with 64 shards
for concurrent access. Each shard contains a HashMap of traces indexed by trace ID.

Responsibilities:

- Track open span count per trace
- Store finished spans until trace is complete
- Store trace propagation data (sampling decision, origin, tags)
- Determine when to flush traces (all spans finished or partial flush threshold)

### DatadogExporter

DatadogExporter buffers span data and manages export to the Datadog Agent via a dedicated worker
thread.

Responsibilities:

- Buffer traces in memory until flush conditions are met
- Provide non-blocking export API

Flush conditions:

- Span count exceeds SPAN_FLUSH_THRESHOLD (3000 spans)
- Time since last flush exceeds MAX_BATCH_TIME (1 second)
- Force flush requested
- Shutdown initiated
